## git automations shell script
-----------------------------------
### Overview
This is a script for automating different git commands and processes, from creation of new local and remote 
repositories, adding remote repositories to local, adding, committing and pushing changes. 

The script was originally created to work on a linux machine, but will be updated to work on other operating systems in the future.
